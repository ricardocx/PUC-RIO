# Analysis and Salary Prediction in the Global AI Market

This repository contains two main projects that analyze and predict salary trends in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) job market for 2025. The projects are built from a comprehensive dataset of over 15,000 AI job postings.

## Dataset

The projects use the **"AI Job Market Analysis Dataset 2025"**, available on Kaggle.

* **Overview:** This dataset was collected through ethical web scraping from global employment platforms such as AngelList, Glassdoor, Indeed, LinkedIn Jobs, and Stack Overflow Jobs.
* **Key Data:** It includes detailed information on job roles, salaries, experience levels, company location, employment type, required skills, and more.

## Project Notebooks

The repository is divided into two notebooks, each with a specific objective.

### 1. MVP-1: Global AI Job Market & Salary Trends 2025 EDA

This notebook focuses on the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the AI job market. The goal is to provide a deep and comparative understanding of global AI employment trends by analyzing the distribution and frequency of different variables, such as job titles and skills.

### 2. MVP-2: Salary Prediction AI Jobs

This second notebook aims to build and evaluate Machine Learning models to predict salaries in AI and ML roles. The project addresses the problem of a lack of a reliable predictive model and seeks to help professionals and companies make strategic decisions.

* **Problem:** The absence of a reliable predictive model to estimate salaries in AI/ML jobs, considering variables like job title, country, experience level, and company size, complicates career planning and talent retention strategies.
* **Insights:** The project offers insights for professionals on the predictability of salaries based on company size. It also provides guidelines for companies of different sizes (small, medium, and large) on how to use salary predictability to attract and retain talent.

## How to Run the Notebooks

To replicate the analysis and models, you will need the following Python libraries, which can be installed via pip or conda:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* plotly
* scikit-learn
* xgboost
* joblib
